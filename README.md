# Mercari-Price-Suggestion-using

**Project: Mercari Price Suggestion using LightGBM**

**Objective:**
The Mercari Price Suggestion project focuses on predicting the price of products based on various features such as brand name, category, item condition, item description, name, shipping, and other relevant parameters. Leveraging LightGBM, a gradient-boosting framework, this project aims to create an effective model for suggesting accurate product prices.

**Data Processing:**
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   - Thorough cleaning of the dataset to handle missing values, and outliers, and ensure data quality.
   - Feature engineering to create meaningful variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Utilized EDA techniques for a comprehensive understanding of feature distributions, relationships, and patterns.
   - Visualizations to highlight key insights and correlations.

**Machine Learning Models:**
Employed LightGBM, a powerful gradient boosting framework known for its efficiency and speed, for price prediction.
1. **LightGBM:**
   - Utilized LightGBM for building an ensemble model capable of handling large datasets efficiently.
   - Adjusted hyperparameters for optimal model performance.
   - Explored feature importance to understand the contribution of each variable to the model.

**Evaluation Metrics:**
Calculated precision and recall to assess the model's performance.
- **Precision:** Measures the accuracy of positive predictions.
- **Recall:** Measures the ability to capture all relevant instances.

**Conclusion:**
The Mercari Price Suggestion project successfully employed LightGBM to create a robust model for predicting product prices. The combination of data preprocessing, thorough EDA, and a well-tuned gradient-boosting model ensures accurate and reliable price suggestions. Precision and recall metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's effectiveness in making precise predictions and capturing relevant instances. This project contributes to enhancing pricing strategies and optimizing user experience on the Mercari platform.
